# For the purposes of goldfishing, we only care about whether a land
# enters untapped and what it taps for -- the token from Khalni Garden
# doesn't matter, for instance. So all untapped colorless lands are
# called Radiant Fountain and all tapped colorless lands are called
# Bojuka Bog ("colorless" in the sense that the only colors we care
# about are blue and green). Vesuva is counted as a tapped colorless
# land and Cavern of Souls as an untapped colorless land.
